### The Private R Repo Manager

Cranium is a web interface for the [miniCRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/miniCRAN/index.html) tool.

You can view the list of packages installed to the private repository, show package descriptions, and upload new packages.

Cranium may be used as an on-premise solution behind a corporate firewall so that an organization may control the packages available to be installed. Reasons for this level of control could include security, licensing, and vetting against internal standards.
